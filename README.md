# Nick's Vim Configuration

## Plugins
* I only install plugins manually. I do so by cloning the plugin repos into my `.vim/pack/opt` directory. Then I manually enable them in my `vimrc`.

### My plugin
* I have my own plugin simply called `nick`. This is where I put simple functions for my own convenience.

## Sessions
* I store all sessions in `.vim/Sessions`. This direcotry has been gitignored for obvious reasons.
